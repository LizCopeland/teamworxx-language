to-allow-pingbacks,-please-also-ensure-the-entry's-guest-view-permission-is-enabled=Pingbacks are special requests that are similar to trackbacks except they're automatically sent when you link to another site. They're easier to use than trackbacks because you don't have to do anything extra: if you link to another site in your blog entry, this site sends a pingback to the other site to notify that site that you linked to it. Similarly, if someone links to your blog entry, this site can receive a pingback from that person's site and record the link.
to-allow-trackbacks,-please-also-ensure-the-entry's-guest-view-permission-is-enabled=Trackbacks are special links that let you notify another site that you linked to them. For example, if you wanted to write an entry in your blog and reference some other site's entry, you might put the URL to the other entry in the Trackbacks to Send field. If you have multiple URLs you want to send trackbacks to, separate them with spaces. If you want others who link to your blog to let you know about the link via trackbacks, leave the Allow Trackbacks box checked. This generates a URL that is displayed with your blog entry. Others who want to link to your entry can use this URL for the link, to send trackbacks to your blog. Note that trackbacks only work when the protocol is supported by both the linker and the linkee.
